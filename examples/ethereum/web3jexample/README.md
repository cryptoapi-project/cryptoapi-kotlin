# Using CryptoApiLib library with [Web3j](https://github.com/web3j/web3j)

## Get started
Ð¡onfigure and return the object of the CryptoAPI class, which will allow to perform all the operations provided by the CryptoApiLib library.
Further, we can use the obtained method to get the CryptoAPI object anywhere in the program.
```kotlin
private val apiClient by lazy {
    private val apiClient = CryptoApiFramework.getInstance(
            CryptoApiConfiguration(
                callTimeout = CALL_TIMEOUT,
                connectTimeout = CONNECT_TIMEOUT,
                readTimeOut = READ_TIMEOUT
            )
        ).ethereumAsyncApi
}
```

## Constant
There is a companion object that contains some constants.
```kotlin
companion object {
    private const val ETH_ADDRESS_1 = "SENDER_ADDRESS"
    private const val ETH_ADDRESS_2 = "RECIPIENT_ADDRESS"

    private const val CALL_TIMEOUT = 30000L
    private const val READ_TIMEOUT = 30000L
    private const val CONNECT_TIMEOUT = 15000L
    private const val SEND_AMOUNT = 10000000000

    private const val WEB3J_ETH_EXAMPLE_KEY = "ETH_LOG"
}
```

## Getting a balance
The following code demonstrates how to obtain a balance using CryptoApiLib.
```kotlin
private val ethAddresses = EthTypedParams(
    ETH_ADDRESS_1,
    ETH_ADDRESS_2
)

val balances = apiClient.getBalances(ethAddresses.getList())
balances.forEach {
    logD(it.balance)
}
```

## Estimating a gas
Now, before creating a transaction, you need to get a `gas estimate`.
```kotlin
private val estimatedGas = EthEstimatedGasCall(
    from = ETH_ADDRESS_1,
    to = ETH_ADDRESS_2,
    value = "10"
)

GlobalScope.launch {
    val estimationGas = apiClient.estimateGas(estimatedGas)
    logD(estimationGas.estimateGas.toString())
    ...
}
```

## Create and send a transaction
CryptoAPI allows you to send raw transactions, but before that you need to prepare it.
Creating and sending a transaction is as follows:
```kotlin
GlobalScope.launch {

    ...
    val rawTransaction = RawTransaction.createEtherTransaction(
        BigInteger.valueOf(estimationGas.nonce.toLong()),
        BigInteger.valueOf(estimationGas.gasPrice),
        BigInteger.valueOf(estimationGas.estimateGas),
        ETH_ADDRESS_2,
        sendAmountBigInt
    )

    val signedMessage =
        TransactionEncoder.signMessage(rawTransaction, Credentials.create(PRIVATE_KEY))
    val hexValue = Numeric.toHexString(signedMessage)

    val result = apiClient.sendRawTransaction(EthTransactionRawCall(hexValue))
    logD(result)
}
```
