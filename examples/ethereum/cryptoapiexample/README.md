# Using CryptoApiLib library

## Get started
Ð¡onfigure and return the object of the CryptoAPI class, which will allow to perform all the operations provided by the CryptoApiLib library.
Further, we can use the obtained method to get the CryptoAPI object anywhere in the program.
```kotlin
private val apiClient by lazy {
    CryptoApiFramework.getInstance(
        CALL_TIMEOUT,
        CONNECT_TIMEOUT,
        READ_TIMEOUT,
        CRYPTO_API_KEY,
        CryptoApi.URL.TESTNET
    ).ethereumAsyncApi
}
```

## Constant
There is a companion object that contains some constants.
```kotlin
companion object {
    private const val CRYPTO_API_ETH_EXAMPLE_KEY = "ETH_LOG"

    private const val CALL_TIMEOUT = 30000L
    private const val READ_TIMEOUT = 30000L
    private const val CONNECT_TIMEOUT = 15000L

    private const val CRYPTO_API_KEY = "YOUR_TOKEN"

    private const val ETH_ADDRESS_1 = "ADDRESS_1"
    private const val ETH_ADDRESS_2 = "ADDRESS_2"

    private const val TX =
        "0xf86e8386ca038602bba7f5220083632ea0941de29f644d555fe9cc3241e1083de0868f959bfa8545d964b800801ca04ef1f13c58af9a9ac4be66b838a238b24db798d585d882865637fdc35bdc49c4a04b7d1dfc3d9672080347a0d3559628f5f757bd6f6a005d1c4f7cdccce020ea02"
}
```

## Getting a balance
The following code demonstrates how to obtain a balance using CryptoApiLib.
```kotlin
private val ethAddresses = EthTypedParams(
    ETH_ADDRESS_1,
    ETH_ADDRESS_2
)

val balances = apiClient.getBalances(ethAddresses.getList())
balances.forEach {
    logD(it.balance)
}
```

## Estimating a gas
Now, before creating a transaction, you need to get a `gas estimate`.
```kotlin
private val estimatedGas = EthEstimatedGasCall(
    from = ETH_ADDRESS_1,
    to = ETH_ADDRESS_2,
    value = "10"
)

GlobalScope.launch {
    val estimationGas = apiClient.estimateGas(estimatedGas)
    logD(estimationGas.estimateGas.toString())
}
```

## Create and send a transaction
CryptoAPI allows you to send raw transactions, but before that you need to prepare it.
Creating and sending a transaction is as follows:
```kotlin
private val ethTransactionRawBody =
    EthTransactionRawCall(
        tx = TX
    )

try {
    val result = apiClient.sendRawTransaction(ethTransactionRawBody)
    logD(result)
} catch (e: Exception) {
    val errors = (e as ApiException).errors
    errors.forEach {
        logD(it.message)
    }
}
```
