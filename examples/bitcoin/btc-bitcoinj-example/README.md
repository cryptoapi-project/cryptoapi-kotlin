# Using CryptoApiLib library with [Bitcoinj](https://bitcoinj.github.io)

## Get started
Ð¡onfigure and return the object of the CryptoAPI class, which will allow to perform all the operations provided by the CryptoApiLib library.
Further, we can use the obtained method to get the CryptoAPI object anywhere in the program.
```kotlin
private val apiClient by lazy {
    CryptoApiFramework.getInstance(
        callTimeout = CALL_TIMEOUT,
        connectTimeout = CONNECT_TIMEOUT,
        readTimeOut = READ_TIMEOUT
    ).bitcoinAsyncApi
}
```

## Constant
There is a companion object that contains some constants.
```kotlin
companion object {
    private const val BTC_MNEMONIC = "YOUR_BTC_MNEMONIC"
    private const val FROM_ADDRESS = "SENDER_ADDRESS"
    private const val TO_ADDRESS = "RECIPIENT_ADDRESS"
    
    private const val CALL_TIMEOUT = 30000L
    private const val READ_TIMEOUT = 30000L
    private const val CONNECT_TIMEOUT = 15000L

    private const val MAINNET_DERIVATION_PART = 0
    private const val TESTNET_DERIVATION_PART = 1
    
    private const val AMOUNT = 1000
    private const val KB_VALUE = 1000

    private const val CRYPTO_API_BTC_LOG_KEY = "BTC_CRYPTO_API_LOG"
}
```

## Additional properties
There are some additional properties which presented below.
```kotlin
/**
 * Represents BTC network 
 */
private val networkParams by lazy {
    TestNet3Params.get()
}

/**
 * Key for address, private or public key generation
 */
private val deterministicKey by lazy {
    val seed = DeterministicSeed(
        BTC_MNEMONIC,
        null,
        "",
        DeterministicHierarchy.BIP32_STANDARDISATION_TIME_SECS.toLong()
    )
    val pathParent = arrayListOf<ChildNumber>().apply {
        add(ChildNumber(44, true))
        add(ChildNumber(TESTNET_DERIVATION_PART, true))
        add(ChildNumber(0, true))
        add(ChildNumber(0, false))
        add(ChildNumber(0, false))
    }

    val wallet = Wallet.fromSeed(networkParams, seed, Script.ScriptType.P2PKH)

    wallet.activeKeyChain!!.getKeyByPath(pathParent, true)
}
```

### Generate address. Get outputs.
The following is an example that shows how to `generate address and obtain unspent outputs` for it using CryptoApiLib.
```kotlin
val ecKey = ECKey.fromPrivate(deterministicKey.privKeyBytes)
val address = Address.fromKey(networkParams, ecKey, Script.ScriptType.P2PKH).toString()

// MARK: Get outputs
// get unspent outputs to calculate balance or build the transaction
val outputs = try {
    apiClient.getOutputs(BtcOutputStatus.unspent, listOf(address))
} catch (ex: Exception) {
    ex.printStackTrace()
    emptyList<BtcOutput>()
}
printLog(outputs.toString())
```

### Create Transaction
CryptoAPI allows you to send raw transactions, but before that you need to prepare it. As a result, you will get a transaction ready to be sent to the network.
`Creating a transaction` is as follows:
```kotlin
// prepare values for transaction
val fromAddress = FROM_ADDRESS
val toAddress = TO_ADDRESS
val amountWithWei = AMOUNT.toBigInteger()
val fee = 1000.toBigInteger()
val privateKey = Hex.toHexString(deterministicKey.privKeyBytes)

//create signed transaction
val signedTransaction = createSignedTransaction(
    fromAddress, toAddress, amountWithWei, fee, Hex.decode(privateKey), outputs
)
```

### Send Transaction
It remains only to `send` the transaction by sending a hash of the transaction using CryptoApi.
```kotlin
// get a transaction hex and send it with CryptoApi
val transactionHex = Hex.toHexString(signedTransaction.unsafeBitcoinSerialize())
try {
    apiClient.sendRawTransaction(BtcRawTransaction(transactionHex))
    printLog("Send success")
} catch (ex: Exception) {
    printLog("Send failure")
}
```

### Calculate fee for transaction
You can `calculate fee` for your transaction based on fee rate for kilobyte.
```kotlin
// first of all, you need to get fee rate for kilobyte
// response has result like "0.00001". Convert it to satoshi if necessary.
val estimatedFeeResponse = apiClient.estimateFee()
val feePerKb = estimatedFeeResponse.toBigDecimal().multiply(1000000.toBigDecimal()).toBigInteger()

// we need to calculate how much the transaction weighs and how many outs we need to take in transaction
// to cover the amount sent and the fee.
var txSize = Transaction(networkParams).messageSize //build transaction like example above and get size

var estimatedFee = BigInteger.ZERO
while (txSize > 0) {
    txSize -= KB_VALUE
    estimatedFee += feePerKb
}

// estimatedFee is the result of estimation of fee
printLog("estimated fee = $estimatedFee")
```
