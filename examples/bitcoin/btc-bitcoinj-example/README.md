# Using CryptoApiLib library with with [Bitcoinj](https://bitcoinj.github.io)

## Get started
Ð¡onfigure and return the object of the CryptoAPI class, which will allow to perform all the operations provided by the CryptoApiLib library.
Further, we can use the obtained method to get the CryptoAPI object anywhere in the program.
```kotlin
private val apiClient by lazy {
    CryptoApiFramework.getInstance(
        CALL_TIMEOUT,
        CONNECT_TIMEOUT,
        READ_TIMEOUT,
        CRYPTO_API_KEY,
        CryptoApi.URL.TESTNET
    ).bitcoinAsyncApi
}
```

## Constant
There is a companion object that contains some constants.
```kotlin
companion object {
    private const val CRYPTO_API_KEY = "YOUR_CRYPTO_API_KEY"
    
    private const val BTC_MNEMONIC = "YOUR_BTC_MNEMONIC"
    private const val FROM_ADDRESS = "SENDER_ADDRESS"
    private const val TO_ADDRESS = "RECIPIENT_ADDRESS"
    
    private const val CALL_TIMEOUT = 30000L
    private const val READ_TIMEOUT = 30000L
    private const val CONNECT_TIMEOUT = 15000L

    private const val MAINNET_DERIVATION_PART = 0
    private const val TESTNET_DERIVATION_PART = 1
    
    private const val AMOUNT = 1000
    private const val KB_VALUE = 1000

    private const val CRYPTO_API_BTC_LOG_KEY = "BTC_CRYPTO_API_LOG"
}
```
